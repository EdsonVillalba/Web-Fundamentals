    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome! to this section about me. Here, I will give you a deeper insight into my background, skills, and
      experience as a programmer. Let me take this opportunity to introduce myself and share my passion for programming.

      I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and the power of coding to create innovative solutions.
      From a very young age I was attracted to computers and the infinite possibilities they offered. During my studies
      in Electrical Engineering I had a semester of programming and it was there that I developed this passion that has
      led me to pursue software development as a second career, with the aim of perfecting my skills and acquiring
      valuable experience.
    </p>
    <p>Education and certifications:
      I am a 10th semester student of Electrical Engineering at the Santiago Mari√±o Polytechnic University Institute in
      Venezuela, and I am also a first-year Software Development student at BYU-Idaho in the USA. Over 3 years as a
      self-taught and university student studying the world of programming and web development, I have acquired a solid
      foundation in various programming languages, algorithms, and software development principles. Additionally, I have
      taken specialized courses and obtained certifications in areas such as web development, data analysis, and machine
      learning.</p>
    <p>Skills and experience:
      Over the years, I have developed proficiency in a variety of programming languages, including Python, PHP, and
      JavaScript. I am well versed in various frameworks and technologies such as React, Next.js and MySQL. My
      experience extends to Frontend Developer, and not so much to Backend, although I know certain concepts of backend
      web development.</p>
    <p>Problem solving approach:
      As a programmer, I enjoy solving complex problems and finding innovative solutions. I approach each challenge with
      a logical and systematic mindset, breaking problems into manageable steps. I am adept at conducting extensive
      research, analyzing requirements and designing efficient algorithms to tackle even the most complex tasks.</p>
    <p>Collaboration and communication:
      I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication in the software development process.
      I am a team player and value open and transparent communication, actively seeking feedback and incorporating it
      into my work. I enjoy working in diverse teams and leveraging the strengths of each team member to generate
      successful results.</p>
    <p>Continuous learning and growth:
      The field of programming is constantly evolving and new technologies and frameworks emerge periodically. I am
      committed to continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest industry trends. I actively participate in
      online courses, conferences, and participate in online coding communities to improve my knowledge and skills.</p>
    <p>Conclusion:
      Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Programming is not just a profession for me; It is a passion
      that drives me to constantly improve and offer high-quality solutions. I'm excited about leveraging my skills,
      experience, and passion for programming to contribute to challenging and impactful projects. I invite you to
      explore my portfolio and projects to gain a deeper understanding of my capabilities. If you have any further
      questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to contact us.</p>
