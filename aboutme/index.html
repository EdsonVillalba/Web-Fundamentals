        Hello, nice to meet you, my name is Edson Luis Villalba Jimenez, I am 31
        years old, single and without children, I am Venezuelan, I currently
        live in Venezuela, specifically in Ciudad Guayana, one of the cities in
        the largest state of Venezuela, which is the state of Bolivar, where one
        of the places is most emblematic tourist attraction in the world called
        Angel Falls, a waterfall 1283 meters high.

        I am a student of Electrical Engineering, currently I only need the
        thesis to obtain my degree, and a self-taught student of Web Development
        with Knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.Js, Bootstrap 5,
        TailWindCss, Python, PHP and SQL. During my professional studies in
        Electrical Engineering I came across the subject of Programming which
        fascinated me, and encouraged me to learn more about the world of web
        development, and supported by the knowledge of my brother who is a
        Computer Engineer I was able to develop interest and to learn more about
        programming and its advantages, that is why I chose the Software
        Development BS degree to also develop professionally.

        I like Soccer, I follow teams like FC Barcelona from Spain or River
        Plate from Argentina, I have a hobby of playing it a lot, I also like to
        read science fiction novels, magic, mangas and history and poetry, and I
        am a fan too. of the Animes.
      </p>

        I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since
        May 30, 2010, I served a rule mission in Venezuela Valencia Mission 2011
        - 2013, and I currently serve in the church as 2nd counselor of the
        bishopric of my neighborhood and teacher of Institute and religion of
        the SEI. My favorite scripture is found in 1 Nephi 2:16, where Nephi
        comments that he had great desires to know the mysteries of God, and God
        visited him and touched his heart, therefore he did not rebel against
        his father who was a prophet. of God as his brothers had done, and it is
        my favorite scripture because many of us, like Nephi, had the desire to
        know what the Church of Christ was, if Joseph had been a Prophet called
        by God and if the Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ,
        Nephi on that occasion was faced with the opportunity to know if his
        father Lehi was a prophet of God or not and in order to know it he
        turned to the Lord to reveal these things to him, and from the testimony
        he received from the spirit , Nephi strove to be obedient to that
        testimony and live the gospel the rest of his days, because he knew that
        God knew it and he could not deny it.
